          You always have been reading wonderful stories...<br/>
          Great Authors, Great Stories, Great Adventures.<br/>
          But what good is a story<br/>
          without an illustration? <br/>
          Think about Jules Verne without Gustave Dor√©?
          <iframe src="https://assets.pinterest.com/ext/embed.html?id=793900240576877946" height="669" width="345" frameborder="0" ></iframe>
          Yes, you see, in your mind, and for generations, those stories had always been illustrated. <br/>
          and the art of the Editor, was to combine text and image. <br/>
          <br />
          No Jules without Gustave!
          <br />
          Here, content creators can create illustrations for already existing stories,<br/>
          and share their work. The goal is to promote and in the future remunerate creator.<br/>
          illustrators, graphists, painters, photographers, 3d modelists, it's open bar<br/>
          <br />
          In the future I will share with creator an other app that will ease the process made with Electron.<br/>
          but for now just share your work, just the link we will not host it.<br/>
          <br/>
          For Now, I invite to read the stories, see where to put
          your illustrations.
          <br />
          we will do the rest.
          <br />
          Also, this is a software hosted on git, then you can clone it.<br/>
          I will add rules later on.
