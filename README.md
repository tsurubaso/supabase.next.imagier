# Welcome to the Imagier!

You always have been reading wonderful stories...  
Great Authors, Great Adventures.  
But what good is a story without an illustration?

Think about **Jules Verne** without *Édouard Riou, Alphonse de Neuville, Léon Benett*, and *Jules Férat*.  
Or  *Bayard* !

Yes, you see, in your mind, and for generations, those stories had always been illustrated.  
The art of the Editor has always been to combine text and image.  
For Jules it was **Pierre-Jules Hetzel**.

## ✏️ What is this project?

Here, content creators can create illustrated stories and share their work.  
The goal is to **promote and, in the future, remunerate creators**:

- Illustrators  
- Graphic designers  
- Painters  
- Photographers  
- 3D artists  

... it's open bar!

## 🔧 What's next?

- I will share with creators another app to simplify the process.
- You will have more control and autonomy.
- Later, I will open this space to writers — but not yet.
- For now, just share your link — we will not host it.

## 📚 How to contribute

I invite you to **read the stories**, see where illustrations can fit,  
and we will take care of the rest.

This software is hosted on GitHub — feel free to **clone it**.  
I will add rules later on, but the first one is:

> 🧾 **Respect the work of others.**

This implies that, in the future, I will better organize the `/public` folder.
For now you have only one big group of related stories and novels.
