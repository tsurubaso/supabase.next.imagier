Welcome to the Imagier!
You always have been reading wonderful stories...
Great Authors, Great Adventures.
But what good is a story without an illustration?
Think about Jules Verne without Gustave Dor√©.
Ok...here it is Bayard, agreed!

Yes, you see, in your mind, and for generations, those stories had always been illustrated.
The art of the Editor has always been to combine text and image.

No Jules without Gustave!
Here, content creators can create illustrated stories, and share their work.
The goal is to promote, and in the future remunerate creator,
illustrators, graphic designers, painters, photographers, 3d artists... it's open bar!

In the future, I will share with creators this app made with Electron that will simplify the process.
You will have more control and autonomy.
Later on, I will also open this space to writers, but not yet.
For now, just share your link, we will not host it.

I invite you to read the stories, see where illustrations can fit, and we will take care of the rest.

Also, this is a software hosted on github, then you can clone it.
I will add rules later on but the first one is to respect the work of others.
This imply that in the future I will need to better organize the public folder.
